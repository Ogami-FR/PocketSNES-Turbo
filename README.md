<br>-**Display of the battery level in the emulator menu.
<br>**-**Overclock and Underclock processor in the emulator.
<br>**-**Backup settings processor frequency by games in the folder ".pocketsnes".
<br>**-**Small graphic redesign.
<br>**-**Adding a key combination on startup to bypass the CPU frequency backup by games: 
<br>Hold [SELECT] just after starting the rom.
<br>**(simple and easy solution to correct a wrong setting save without using a PC to remove the "* .turbo" backup)
